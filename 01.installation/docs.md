To install Reel move the ``/addons/reel/`` directory to your ``/system/user/addons/`` folder. Also copy the ``/themes/user/reel/`` folder to the ``/themes/user/`` directory in your ExpressionEngine install. Login to your control panel and visit the Developer > Add-on Manager page, and click the Install link for Reel.

## Differences from Wyvern Video

Reel is the ExpressionEngine 3+ version of Wyvern Video. Many of the features found in Wyvern Video are available in Reel, however, due to the maintainability concerns, and general lack of use, one feature was removed, which is the ability to embed a video inside of a WYSIWYG editor (such as Wygwam, Wyvern, or the native RTE).

## Upgrading from Wyvern Video

If you are upgrading from ExpressionEngine 2 to 3 and previously used Wyvern Video, the upgrade process should be seemless. Simply install Reel in ExpressionEngine 3 once you have upgraded. All the Wyvern Video fields will be converted to Reel, then un-install Wyvern Video and delete its files.
