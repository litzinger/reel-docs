To install Reel move the ``/addons/reel/`` directory to your ``/system/user/addons/`` folder. Also copy the ``/themes/user/reel/`` folder to the ``/themes/user/`` directory in your ExpressionEngine install. Login to your control panel and visit the Developer > Add-on Manager page, and click the Install link for Reel.
