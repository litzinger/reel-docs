Reel is currently in beta, meaning it is not feature complete and there will be bugs.

## Features still to be implemented

- Search for video by URL or ID
- Upgrading from Wyvern Video in ExpressionEngine 2
- Matrix support
- Bloqs support
- Low Variables support

These features will be added back over the course of the beta period in subsequent releases.
